
General
-------

Thingamablog is a cross-platform, standalone blogging application
that makes authoring and publishing your weblogs almost effortless. 
Unlike most blogging solutions, Thingamablog does NOT require a 
third-party blogging host, a cgi/php enabled web host, or a MySQL 
database. In fact, all you need to setup, and manage, a blog with 
Thingamablog is FTP, SFTP, or network access to a web server.
